# Use  type(category): description [flags]
# Where type is one of the following:
# 
# breaking
# build
# ci
# chore
# docs
# feat
# fix
# other
# perf
# refactor
# revert
# style
# test
#
# Where flags is an optional comma-separated list of one or more of the following (must be surrounded in square brackets):
#
# breaking: alters type to be a breaking change
# And category can be anything of your choice. If you use a type not found in the list (but it still follows the same format of the message), it'll be grouped under other.
